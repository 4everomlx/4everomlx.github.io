# 💌 Love Letter 💌  

**My dearest sayang Lixian,**  

There are no words that exist in this world to describe my love for you. 💖 Every thought I have screams your name, every heartbeat I have whispers your name, and every dream I have, it's you I’m holding close. 💭💞  

Every second, every minute, every moment is a blessing with you, my dear. 🌷 I have said this before, but I repeat once again, my love Lixian— I am a very average person, but ever since you came into my life, I have started to change for the better of you and me. 👫💞  

Your kiss, your touch, your eyes, your smile, your face—simply heaven on earth without entering it. 😘💖 If life were a journey, then you are my destination. If love were the ocean, then I am forever lost in you. 🌊❤️  

You have given me something that no one else ever could—a love and care so deep and pure. 💎 I promise to stay by your side through the ups and downs, through the good days and the bad days. 💑 My love for you is not just for today or tomorrow—it is for eternity. ♾️  

So, my **wifey**, take all the happiness in this world, and if there is any sorrow, let me take them for you. 💖 I want you to follow a quote:  

> **“Life is yours, death is mine;**  
> **Peace is yours, stress is mine;**  
> **Happiness is yours, sorrow is mine;**  
> **Everything is yours, but YOU ARE MINE.”** 💍💞  
 
**Your wifey,**  
**O ❤️**
